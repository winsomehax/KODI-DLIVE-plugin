# KODI-DLIVE.plugin

Welcome to my DLIVE addon for KODI

I hope you get some use out of it. Feel free to feedback any suggestions and/or code improvements.

Instructions:

* Install the add-on
* Set your DLIVE name. You can get this from the DLIVE website. Open the profile for your account and then the settings - and finally the Display Name

Once you have given the add-on your display name, it will access the DLive website to get the list of streamers you follow. 

NOTE: You will not be asked for a password. This is not a security problem. You can see who other users follow via the DLIVE website. This addon DOES NOT require special access or permissions to your DLive account. It cannot access your account's private settings or data. It only uses publicly available information.

By default the username is set to DLive - the offical DLive account.

Open the addon and it will show the main menu:

1) Your DLIVE username is: DLive
2) Currently live streamers you follow
...

Selecting option 1 will allow you to enter your DLIVE display name - example: RevengeoftheCis (NOTE: this is case sensitive) - you do not need to supply a password

Option 2 will list any DLive user you are following that is also live at the moment.

Once you have a list of streams, select one and... enjoy watching.

Disclaimer

It's yours. If you break it, you can keep the pieces. If you want to add stuff feel free. You just need to follow the GPL and make your improvements available to others.
