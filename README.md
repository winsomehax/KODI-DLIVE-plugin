# KODI-DLIVE.plugin

Welcome to my DLIVE addon for KODI

I hope you get some use out of it. Feel free to feedback any suggestions and/or code improvements.

Instructions:

* Install the add-on
* Set your DLIVE name. You can get this from the DLIVE website. Open the profile for your account and then the settings - and finally the Display Name

Once you have given the add-on your display name, it will access the DLive website to get the list of streamers you follow. 

NOTE: You will not be asked for a password. This is not a security problem. You can see who other users follow via the DLIVE website.  The add-on is not designed to replace the functions of the website for managing your account. For example: if you want to follow or unfollow a streamer you need to login to your account on the DLive website. This add-on only uses publicly available information and allows you to view streams. It does NOT require special access or permissions to your DLive account and cannot access your account's private settings or data.

By default the username is set to DLive - the offical DLive account.

Open the addon and it will show the main menu:

1) Your DLIVE username is: DLive
2) Currently live streamers you follow
...

Selecting option 1 will allow you to enter your DLIVE display name - example: RevengeoftheCis (NOTE: this is case sensitive) - you do not need to supply a password

Option 2 will list any DLive user you are following that is also live at the moment.

Once you have a list of streams, select one and... enjoy watching.

## IMPORTANT

If you used an older version of this add-on, it asked for your DLive user id (this is the blockchain id that never changes) and store that in KODI settings. Now the add-on uses the DLive Display Name and stores that in settings. 

So if upgrading may need you to enter your DLive display name again for some of the functions to work correctly.

### Disclaimer

It's yours. If you break it, you can keep the pieces. If you want to add stuff feel free. You just need to follow the GPL and make your improvements available to others.

### Support
Like KODI, this add-in code is free and will remain so. If you'd like to support work on it, then it would be appreciated. Throw a few satoshis (Bitcoin) to:
